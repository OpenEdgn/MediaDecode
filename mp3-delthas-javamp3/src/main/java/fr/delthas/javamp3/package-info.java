 * JavaMP3 is a fast and lightweight library that can read and decode MPEG data into raw PCM sound data samples, to be then read by the {@link javax.sound.sampled} API, or by other libraries such as OpenAL (through LWJGL).
 * <p>
 * You may refer to the project README (on Github) for some context and various examples on how to use the library.
 * <p>
 * The only public class of the library is the {@link fr.delthas.javamp3.Sound} class, whose Javadoc may be of interest to learn how to use the library.
